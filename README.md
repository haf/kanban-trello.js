kanban-trello.js
================

A Greasemonkey plugin that colours the columns of a trello board according to
the number of cards and the numbers in square brackets. [4-5] or [3] would both work.

Writing [4-5] in a heading of a column means that the column should preferrably contain
>= 4 cards and at most 5 cards.

Writing [3] on top of a column means that the column should max contain 3 cards, or
otherwise be marked red.
