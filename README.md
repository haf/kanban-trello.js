kanban-trello.js
================

![Life is great, ainnit?](https://raw.github.com/haf/kanban-trello.js/master/screen.png)

A [Greasemonkey](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/greasemonkey/) plugin that colours the columns of a trello board according to
the number of cards and the numbers in square brackets. [4-5] or [3] would both work.

Writing [4-5] in a heading of a column means that the column should preferrably
contain >= 4 cards and at most 5 cards.

Writing [3] on top of a column means that the column should max contain 3 cards, or
otherwise be marked red.

[Install it now!](https://github.com/haf/kanban-trello.js/raw/master/kanban-trello.user.js)*

You can check whether it's working on [this sample board](https://trello.com/b/a2soLtdk/showcasing-kanban).
